"As a student, I want to learn technology through real-world scenarios, so that I can acquire practical skills and knowledge that will be useful in my future career. By developing the MyWebClass.org website template, we can provide an integrated learning experience that contextualizes technology with business processes, resulting in a realistic and hands-on environment for students to learn. This will enable us to improve the learning experience of students and help them acquire the skills and knowledge they need to succeed in their future careers. By following lean and agile methodologies, we can quickly and effectively develop the website template, incorporating basic on-page SEO requirements, Google Analytics tracking codes and goals, and features such as an authentication system, a course management system, a feedback system, and a progress tracking system. This will set us up for long-term benefits by providing a platform that will continue to improve and evolve over time, meeting the changing needs of students, teachers, and administrators."
